# Subreddit Categories

This is just an idea I've been playing around with.
It started when I was doing some tutorials for React and Redux.

It simply pulls posts from a subreddit entered by the user.
It splits the posts into categories based on the flash in the title of the post.
It displays the posts split up into the categories it finds or "NONE" if no flash is present in the title.

This is a work in progress and I'll be adding features and functionality as I think of it.
